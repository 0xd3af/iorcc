What it does:
===
Just plays tic tac toe. Stupidly.

NOTE: This is _not_ an actual obfuscated example. It does nothing clever at all. It's just meant as a template for how to structure your entry.


How to run it:
===

Either run ruby code/runme.rb and play interactively, or

```ruby
require 'tic_tac_toe.rb'
game = TicTacToe.new
game.input '3' # ... etc - board is ordered left->right, top->bottom, starting from 0
```
